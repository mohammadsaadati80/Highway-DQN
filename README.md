# Highway DQN Deep Reinforcement Learning 

Homework #5, Interactive Learning Course, University of Tehran

In this exercise, we worked with the famous [highway](https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env) environment. 
This environment has been implemented in the gym library, and existing tasks such as parking tasks, crossing four roads, etc. are defined in this environment. 
The issues in this environment are related to the autonomous drive task in a 2D environment.

In this exercise, we solve the [merge-v0](https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env#merge) and [highway-v0](https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env#highway) tasks by using `Deep Q-Learning (DQN)` and `DQN with Prioritized Experience Replay` algorithms.
